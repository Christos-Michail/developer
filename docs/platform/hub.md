## Introduction

The [WeNet HUB](https://internetofus.u-hopper.com/prod/hub/frontend) is the place to checkout for getting started with WeNet.

It is the place where the profile information is managed, the available applications can be discovered and browsed, developers can setup and configure new applications.

## Usage

The steps for creating an account and filling the profile are simple:

1. Sign by specifying username, email and a password
2. You should receive an email, activate your account following the instructions (itâ€™s as simple as clicking on a button)
3. Fill in your profile with, at least, the required fields.

You are now good to go!

You can browse around looking for applications to test.
You can also become a _developer_ - this is possible from the profile section - in order to unlock all functionalities allowing to create brand new applications and propose them to the community.
